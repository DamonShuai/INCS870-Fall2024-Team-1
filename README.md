# INCS870-Fall2024-Team-1
**Overview**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named Final.ipynb, which focuses on analyzing and processing the IDS 2018 dataset. The dataset is provided by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity and is widely used for network intrusion detection system (NIDS) research.

**Dataset**

The IDS 2018 dataset is a comprehensive dataset designed for evaluating intrusion detection systems. It includes diverse types of network traffic, including normal behavior, as well as various attack scenarios (e.g., DoS, DDoS, brute force, infiltration).

For more information about the dataset, visit the official website: [IDS 2018 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html).

**Features**

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and normalization.

- Feature Engineering: Identifies and selects the most important features using [e.g., feature importance techniques].

- Machine Learning: Implements supervised and unsupervised models for detecting network anomalies.

- Visualization: Includes visualizations of attack distributions and model performance.

**Requirements**

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
